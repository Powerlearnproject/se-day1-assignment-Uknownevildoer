Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering- is the branch of computer science that ddeals with the design,   development, testing and maintenance of software applications.
  a).Quality and Reliability- software engineering principles help create high-quality, bug-free and secure software.
  b).Security- software engineering practices are essential for building secure systems that protect sensitive data and prevent cyber threats.
  c).Scalability- well designed software can handle growing user demands without perfomance consumption.
  d).Efficiency- optimized codde and structured development processes improve system perfomance and reduce resource consumption.
  e).User experience- Good software engineering improves usability, accessibility and overall customer satisfaction.
  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  a).Development of programming languages
  b).Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
  c).rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  a).Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  b).Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  c).Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  d).Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  e).Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  f).Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
waterfall is rigid while agile is flexible.
Testing in waterfall is done after development while in agile it happens in iterations.
waaterfall is used where there is strict planning, documentation, and regulatory requirements exist while agile is used where the needs evolve such as developing a mobile product.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing sotware solutions.
Project manager- oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Quality assurance Engineer- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a).integrated development environment are software suites that provide comprehensive  tools for writing, debugging and testing code.example Visual Studdio Code.
b).Version Control Sytstems are software tools useful for tracking changes to source code an coordingating work among team members.example Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
